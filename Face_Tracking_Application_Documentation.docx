Face Tracking Application

A responsive face tracking web application built with Next.js, face-api.js, and Tailwind CSS. The app allows users to record videos with a live face tracking marker overlay, save recordings locally (with audio), and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Features
- Face Tracking: Real-time face detection using open-source face-api.js.
- Video Recording: Record video with face marker overlay and audio using the MediaRecorder API.
- Local Storage: Save and manage recordings locally in the browser (using IndexedDB for large files).
- Responsive Design: Fully responsive UI for desktop and mobile, styled with Tailwind CSS.
- Manage Recordings: View, play, and delete saved videos.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-directory>
2. Install dependencies:

   # or
   yarn install
3. Run the development server:
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
4. Open your browser:

Model Files
- Face-api.js models are stored in public/models/. These are required for face detection to work. If you deploy elsewhere, ensure these files are included.

2. Position your face in the frame. The app will highlight your face with a marker.
3. Click Start Recording to record video (with marker and audio).
4. Click Stop Recording to finish and save the video.
5. View, play, or delete your saved videos in the Saved Videos section.
